The main differences between creating scripts in Databricks notebooks versus using Visual Studio Code with VSConnect (Databricks extension) are as follows:

Databricks Notebooks

Built-in Integration: Databricks notebooks are part of the Databricks environment, providing a seamless integration with the Databricks cluster.

Interactive Development: Allows for interactive data exploration, where users can run cells independently and see results quickly, especially useful for data exploration and iterative development.

Multi-Language Support: You can use multiple languages (Python, Scala, SQL, R) within the same notebook using magic commands (%python, %scala, etc.).

Visualization: Databricks notebooks offer built-in visualization tools for displaying data and charting results easily.

Collaboration: Real-time collaboration is possible in Databricks notebooks, where multiple users can work on the same notebook simultaneously.

Job Scheduling: Notebooks can be scheduled as jobs directly within Databricks, making it easy to automate workflows.

Version Control: Built-in version control within Databricks allows users to track changes at the notebook level, though itâ€™s not as robust as Git-based version control.


VS Code with VSConnect (Databricks Extension)

Local Development Environment: Allows for developing Databricks code in the local environment, benefiting from VS Code's robust feature set, such as extensions, debugging, and code linting.

Version Control with Git: Full integration with Git, allowing better version control, branching, and collaboration through code reviews.

Enhanced IDE Features: Offers better autocomplete, refactoring tools, and debugging capabilities, improving development productivity compared to Databricks notebooks.

Offline Development: You can develop scripts offline using VS Code and sync to Databricks later when you're connected to the Databricks environment.

Script Execution: You can run your scripts locally or directly on the Databricks cluster from within VS Code, thanks to the Databricks extension.

File-Based Structure: Unlike notebooks, which are cell-based, VS Code allows you to work with a more traditional script or module-based code structure.

Less Interactive: Lacks the interactivity of notebooks for data exploration, as VS Code is primarily a code editor and not meant for running code interactively like a notebook.


Summary

Databricks notebooks are ideal for collaborative, interactive data exploration and for quickly running code on the Databricks cluster.

VS Code with VSConnect provides a more robust coding environment with advanced IDE features, better version control, and support for developing complex scripts or packages but lacks the immediate interactivity of Databricks notebooks.
