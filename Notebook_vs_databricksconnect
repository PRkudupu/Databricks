The main differences between creating scripts in Databricks notebooks versus using Visual Studio Code with VSConnect (Databricks extension) are as follows:

Databricks Notebooks

Built-in Integration: Databricks notebooks are part of the Databricks environment, providing a seamless integration with the Databricks cluster.

Interactive Development: Allows for interactive data exploration, where users can run cells independently and see results quickly, especially useful for data exploration and iterative development.

Multi-Language Support: You can use multiple languages (Python, Scala, SQL, R) within the same notebook using magic commands (%python, %scala, etc.).

Visualization: Databricks notebooks offer built-in visualization tools for displaying data and charting results easily.

Collaboration: Real-time collaboration is possible in Databricks notebooks, where multiple users can work on the same notebook simultaneously.

Job Scheduling: Notebooks can be scheduled as jobs directly within Databricks, making it easy to automate workflows.

Version Control: Built-in version control within Databricks allows users to track changes at the notebook level, though it’s not as robust as Git-based version control.


VS Code with VSConnect (Databricks Extension)

Local Development Environment: Allows for developing Databricks code in the local environment, benefiting from VS Code's robust feature set, such as extensions, debugging, and code linting.

Version Control with Git: Full integration with Git, allowing better version control, branching, and collaboration through code reviews.

Enhanced IDE Features: Offers better autocomplete, refactoring tools, and debugging capabilities, improving development productivity compared to Databricks notebooks.

Offline Development: You can develop scripts offline using VS Code and sync to Databricks later when you're connected to the Databricks environment.

Script Execution: You can run your scripts locally or directly on the Databricks cluster from within VS Code, thanks to the Databricks extension.

File-Based Structure: Unlike notebooks, which are cell-based, VS Code allows you to work with a more traditional script or module-based code structure.

Less Interactive: Lacks the interactivity of notebooks for data exploration, as VS Code is primarily a code editor and not meant for running code interactively like a notebook.


Summary

Databricks notebooks are ideal for collaborative, interactive data exploration and for quickly running code on the Databricks cluster.

VS Code with VSConnect provides a more robust coding environment with advanced IDE features, better version control, and support for developing complex scripts or packages but lacks the immediate interactivity of Databricks notebooks.

Here’s a detailed comparison of Databricks notebooks and VS Code with Databricks Connect (VSConnect) with their pros, cons, and steps to get started with each:

Databricks Notebooks

Pros:

Ease of Use: Direct integration with the Databricks environment simplifies working with clusters, data, and libraries.

Interactive Data Exploration: Cells can be run individually, which allows users to see immediate feedback and results.

Multi-language Support: Allows combining Python, Scala, R, and SQL in a single notebook.

Built-in Visualizations: Provides built-in tools for data visualization, making exploratory data analysis straightforward.

Collaboration: Real-time collaboration with other team members is possible, similar to Google Docs.

Job Scheduling: Notebooks can be turned into jobs and scheduled for regular execution.

Cluster Integration: Automatic connection to Databricks clusters without additional setup.


Cons:

Limited IDE Features: Lacks advanced IDE features such as autocomplete, linting, and debugging compared to tools like VS Code.

Less Control Over Versioning: Built-in version control is less flexible compared to Git and other versioning systems.

Limited Script Structure: Working with large projects is less structured compared to traditional code editors, making it challenging to manage code across multiple files or packages.

Performance Overhead: Loading larger notebooks with a lot of cells can slow down the interface.

Non-replicable Locally: Code execution is tied to the Databricks cluster, making it harder to run locally.


Steps to Get Started:

1. Login to Databricks: Access your Databricks workspace via your cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP).


2. Create a Cluster: Set up a cluster if one isn’t already available.


3. Create a Notebook: From the Databricks workspace, select “Create” and choose “Notebook.”


4. Write Code: Use cells to write Python, SQL, Scala, or R code.


5. Run Cells: Execute code cell-by-cell to explore data and build your analysis.


6. Visualize: Use the built-in plotting features for data visualizations.


7. Share and Collaborate: Share the notebook with colleagues or schedule it as a job.

VS Code with Databricks Connect (VSConnect)

Pros:

Full IDE Features: Advanced features like autocompletion, debugging, refactoring, and linting improve developer productivity.

Better Version Control: Direct Git integration allows for better version management, collaboration, and code reviews.

Local Development: Enables local development with VS Code, allowing users to write and test code before deploying to Databricks.

Script-Based Structure: Ideal for working on larger codebases with multiple files or complex projects.

Run Code on Databricks Cluster: You can execute scripts directly on the Databricks cluster, just like in a notebook.

Customizable Environment: More control over the development environment and dependencies, as it’s not bound to Databricks constraints.


Cons:

Less Interactive: Lacks the interactive nature of notebooks, making data exploration and quick analysis harder.

Setup Complexity: Initial setup of Databricks Connect requires configuration steps, unlike notebooks, which work out-of-the-box.

Cluster Dependency: Running code still requires connecting to Databricks clusters, which may not be ideal for completely offline work.

No Built-in Visualization: You have to manually integrate visualization libraries, as there’s no built-in visualization like in Databricks notebooks.


Steps to Get Started:

1. Install VS Code: Ensure you have Visual Studio Code installed.


2. Install Databricks Extension:

In VS Code, navigate to the Extensions tab and search for "Databricks VSCode."

Install the extension.



3. Configure Databricks Connect:

Install Databricks Connect locally via pip (pip install databricks-connect).

Configure it with your Databricks cluster settings (e.g., Databricks Host, Cluster ID, Token) via a configuration file or CLI.



4. Set up a Python Environment: Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies (python -m venv venv).


5. Write Code Locally: Develop your scripts or notebooks within VS Code.


6. Run Code on Databricks: Use the extension to submit the code to your Databricks cluster or execute it locally for testing.


7. Version Control: Use Git or another version control system for managing code changes and collaboration.


8. Deploy to Databricks: Once the code is tested, sync it with Databricks for production or further processing.

Summary Table

In general, Databricks notebooks are great for quick, exploratory data analysis, while VS Code with Databricks Connect is better suited for more complex, structured development projects with full IDE support.
