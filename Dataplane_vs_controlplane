The Databricks Platform Architecture is divided into two main planes: the **Control Plane** and the **Data Plane**. Here’s a breakdown of the elements in each:

### **Control Plane**
- **Managed by Databricks**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Cluster Management**: Handles the creation, configuration, and termination of clusters.
  - **Job Management**: Manages job scheduling, execution, and monitoring.
  - **Notebooks and Libraries**: Stores notebooks, libraries, and other configurations.
  - **Authentication and Authorization**: Manages user authentication, access control, and permissions.
  - **Databricks Web Application**: The user interface where users interact with Databricks notebooks, jobs, clusters, etc.
  - **Monitoring and Logging**: Collects and stores logs, metrics, and monitoring data related to the operation of clusters and jobs.

### **Data Plane**
- **Managed by the Customer in their Cloud Account**
- **Responsibilities**:
  - **Data Storage**: All data, including raw and processed data, is stored in the customer’s cloud account (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage).
  - **Compute Resources**: All clusters and compute resources run in the customer’s cloud environment. This includes the VMs or instances where the actual data processing takes place.
  - **Network Security**: Data Plane resources are within the customer's VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) or VNet (Virtual Network), and they control security groups, subnets, and firewall rules.
  - **Data Processing**: All data processing, such as executing notebooks, Spark jobs, and ML models, occurs in the Data Plane.

### **Customer’s Cloud Account**
- **Components**:
  - **Storage Accounts**: For storing data, including Delta Lake, Parquet files, and other data formats.
  - **Virtual Machines/Instances**: For running Databricks clusters and other compute resources.
  - **Networking**: Virtual Networks (VPCs/VNets), subnets, security groups, and other networking components are managed by the customer.
  - **IAM Roles/Policies**: The customer controls access through IAM roles and policies that define which services and users can access the resources in their cloud account.

In summary:
- **Control Plane**: Managed by Databricks, responsible for orchestration, management, and monitoring.
- **Data Plane**: Managed by the customer, responsible for data storage and processing within their cloud account.
